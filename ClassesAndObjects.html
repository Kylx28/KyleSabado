            <p>An <b>object</b> is a data type that has its own attributes and methods, and is the basis of Object-Oriented Programming.
              <br>
              <br>
              A <b>class</b> is a Java file created by the user that describes the attributes and behaviors of objects. It is the framework from which objects are created.

        <h2>Implemetation</h2>
        <h3>How To Implement a Class:</h3>
        <p>
          1. You need to give your class a name and create a java file without main. For example, a car class would be.
          <br><br>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCar.java
          <br><br>
          2. Next, you need to create private instance variables (PIVs) at the top of your class. These PIVs are the attributes of the object this class describes.
          <br><br>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspString manufacturer;
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspString type;
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspString name;
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspString colour;
          <br><br>
          3. Then, you need to create a constructor for your class. This determines which parameters are passed when creating an object.
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou can also have other constructors that take a different number of parameters or have default values.
          <br><br>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic Car(String manufacturer, String type, String name, String colour){
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis.manufacturer = manufacturer;
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis.type = type;
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis.name = name;
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis.colour = colour;
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp{
          <br><br>
          4. You also need to create getter and setter methods for each PIV. These will return each PIV, and allow the user to modify their values.
          <br><br>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic String getName(){
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn name;
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}
          <br><br>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic void setName(String name){
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis.name = name;
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}
          <br><br>
          5. Setters and getters are the standard methods, but you are able to create any number of unique behavior methods as you want. 
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThese behavior methods are what give objects their function. For example, here's a method that will compare
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe names of two car objects and return true if they are the same.
          <br><br>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic boolean sameName(Car car2){
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn name.equals(car2.getName);
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}
          <br><br>
          6. Finally, each class needs a way of printing the object. You typically want to print the PIVs of each object.
          <br><br>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic String toString(){
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn "Manufacturer: " + manufacturer + "\n"
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn "Type: " + type + "\n"
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn "Name: " + name + "\n"
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn "Colour: " + colour;
          <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}
          <br><br>
        </p>
